# PDF to text conversion

**Goal:** To extract text from PDF files to be used for further text analysis.
**Situation:** In some projects I work on, a subset of reports come in the form of PDF files which cannot be easily read in like CSVs or TXT files. This means that PDF data is often excluded from the projects or require extensive resources to manually transcribe the contents of each PDF.
